Build a responsive, dark-mode casino demo site inspired by Roobet.
No real money features — this is visual only.

Overall style

Dark background (#0e0f13) with glassmorphism cards and neon accents.

Accent colors: electric blue (#00c2ff), purple (#7c3aed), lime green (#2bd975).

Rounded corners (xl–2xl), soft shadows, subtle glow effects.

Clean sans font (Inter or Poppins).

Navigation

Sticky top navbar with:

Left: logo text “NEON CASINO” (blue + white).

Center links: Home, Games, Promotions, Provably Fair, Leaderboard.

Right: wallet balance pill + sign in button.

On mobile, collapse links into hamburger menu.

Home Page

Hero section: large centered text “Play & Win with Provably Fair Games”, CTA button “Play Games”. Background: gradient glow or neon effect.

Featured Games grid: 3–6 cards with game icons (Crash, Mines, Plinko, Limbo, Dice, Roulette). Each card: neon outline, icon, name, “Play Now” button.

Trending Bets ticker (visual only): horizontally scrolling fake bets like “User123 won 5,000 ROO on Crash (12x)”.

Promotions carousel: wide cards with neon banners, e.g. “Daily Bonus”, “Leaderboard Rewards”.

Provably Fair teaser: card with lock icon and “Verify every game outcome”.

Games Page

Sidebar: vertical list of games with icons (Crash, Mines, Plinko, Limbo, Dice). Active game is highlighted neon.

Main panel: large placeholder area that says e.g. “CRASH — Demo Preview” with a styled frame.

For each game selection, just swap the header text and maybe show a themed image or background (no logic required).

Keep balance pill and “Place Bet” button visible for visual effect (not functional).

Footer

Split layout:

Left: mini logo + text “Demo site. No real-money gambling.”

Center: small uppercase links (Terms, Privacy, Responsible Play, Contact).

Right: “© 2025 Neon Casino Demo • 18+ Only”.

Extra polish

Hover animations: cards lift 2px, neon glows intensify.

Buttons: gradient backgrounds with glow.

Animations: fade-in sections, smooth scrolling.

Mobile responsive: featured games collapse to 1–2 per row, sidebar becomes horizontal scroll.

Deliverables

Two pages: index.html (Home) and games.html (Games).

TailwindCSS for styling.

Use placeholder images/icons (Feather or Lucide icons).

Include basic JS only for page transitions (no game logic).
